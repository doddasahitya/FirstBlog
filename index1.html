  Appy Fizz is a sparkling drink that describes itself as 'the champagne of fruit drinks'.
 The new Appy Fizz website was part of a more extensive rebranding project by NYC-based design firm Sagmeister & Walsh.
 As the creators explain in their case study, the identity "visualises carbonated bubbles through a dynamic graphic language of 3D spheres and circles."</p>
<p>
The design is an interesting mix of super-flat and implied three-dimensional elements. The circular language written in bold red, white and black reminds me of the work of Yayoi Kusama, the world- renowned artist associated with pop art, minimalism and polka dots.
  </p>
  <p>Art and its space in commercial industries is a theme Sagmeister & Walsh play with throughout their work, and it's interesting to see how this combination translates to the web.
     Here there are many animations and interactive canvas elements that speak the same visual language – a carbonation simulation even follows the user's mouse around as it is moved across the website.</p>

  <div >
    <p>Made by Few is an annual web conference hosted by Few, a design and development agency in Arkansas.
      Sally Nixon’s detailed, bright illustrations feature in the masthead and the speaker descriptions, and it takes a moment to realise there is repetition in the crowd, because it's so subtle.
    </p>

    <p>As you explore the site, there are more surprises.
 "At Few, we love pleasant accidents and encourage exploration," says Arlton Lowry, co-founder of Few and conference organiser.
 Sticking close to their philosophy of exploration, there are hidden gems scattered throughout the site (we won’t give them all away, but try hitting the Konami Code!).
    </p>
    <p>
These fun elements give the site a lot of personality that Arlton attributes directly to the agency culture.
"We believe when you provide people with an open and fun environment, there’s no telling what will come of it."</p>

    <figcaption>Strong product photography gives this site impact</figcaption>
    <div>
      <p>Allbirds is a sports shoe brand from the land of 29,221,344 sheep.
        It began when co-founder Tim Brown observed the amazing qualities of Merino wool, and wondered why it had never been used in footwear before.
      </p>
      <p>The website, which has been built using Shopify, mixes lifestyle photography with illustrations.
         The result is a delightful experience that doesn’t just tell the story behind the Allbirds, but also gives you a feel for the product itself.
      </p>
      <p>"It’s designed to showcase the incredible attention to detail and thought behind our product design," explains Brown on the reasoning behind the site.
        "We invested heavily in photography – and NYC-based kiwi photographer Henry Hargreaves – to bring the site to life and articulate our mission of making better shoes in a better way."
      </p>
      <p>Both Brown and the Red Antler team talk of their extreme dedication to the UX of the site and how they leaned into the details that so often are overlooked.
        The mundane FAQ section is brought to life with animated GIFs, and illustration is used throughout the site as unexpected storytelling motif.</p>
